<h2 align="left">About Myself -</h2>

###

<h4 align="left">I am a Student at the University of London currently studying Computer Science.  I am teaching myself HTML and the other assorted web languages in my own time to host my own website. I also have recently got into Roblox game development and am teaching myself that as a hobby. <br><br>I have been a student at the EKC Group Cantebury College from 2020 to 2022 and studied Computer Science there, whilst attending that college i found more of an interest with technology than i had before which helped me find out what i wanted to pursue later in my life. My current university course is only intersting me more in Computer Sceince and i hope to be able to make some programs and upload them here.</h4>
